The associate can take a long time to set their headset channel. They also don't have not much to do with fixing these headsets other than recharge the battery. In the end of the journey, they also need to return the headset back before heading back home.<br><br> -->
<!-- 
				Based on these methods, we gathered many user behaviors and thoughts and map them onto the customer journey map in order to discover and discuss the crucial down-moments.<br><br> -->
<!-- 				1) Additional and intrusive steps are required to rent the assistive devices. <br><br>
				2)Associates are not proficient in setting up the descriptive devices and charge the devices in time. <br><br>

				3)Headsets have a high failure rate due to weak broadcast, not well charged and they are often dirty/unsanitary being used by multiple people.<br><br>

				4)Limited devices number in every theater. The manager told us there once is a visually impaired people club that comes to the cinema, but they only have 10 devices which frustrate those movie lovers -->

				<span class="pjcont1"><b>Concept 1: Smart Kiosks</b><br><br>
					This solution will aim to cut out interaction with theater associates, who are often times undertrained and cause unnecessary frustrations for visually impaired moviegoers. Additionally, we envision the kiosks to be a universal solution and a one-stop shop for all moviegoers to purchase or pickup tickets and retrieve assistive devices. While we are focused on the visually impaired, this solution could also have a broader adaptation for those who need different types of assistance, such as hearing devices.

				<span class="pjcont1"><b>Concept 2: In-theater Service App, leveraging existing devices</b><br><br>

					Through our user testing, we discovered the following main problems.<br><br>
					
					<b>Alternative ways to make up vision requirment cause users mental burden.<br></b> Despite what we think that scan feature can reduce the interactions in selecting both movie and cinema, before even tried out, 3/7 of the participants become anxious in hearing the this feature. Also, 3/7 of the users preferred to upload their e-ticket rather than phycially scan tickets.<br><br>
					<b>Users move when complete tasks.<br></b> Through role playing, we discovered that when in some use cases, users prefer to select the movie before heading to the theater. We neglected these pre-selection lovers and didn't implement a way for them to choose movies ahead of time.<br><br>
					<b>When abstracted from physical theater context, users fail to recognize the meaning of each process. <br></b> While we referenced the headset renting process thinking it is a more user-familiar flow, our user testing demostrated that when it shifts to mobile application, users will not transfer their past renting experience. They are expecting as easier process that one simple tap can access the descriptive audio which imply a need for simplier process. Questions like I need to go to movie screen or why do I need to test an audio are asked. Also, most users have a preferred cinema,requiring users to select a cinema cause longer option flow.
