                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> I support Pulse product growth by providing solutions through user interfaces. I translated product requirements into prototypes, and validate solutions by user testing. I designed in a Scrum Sprint process.  Designs usually need to handoff two months ahead of the development cycle. I share my design update every week with my Product Manager and every two weeks with the dev team. This helps to bring the whole team into the discussion about edge cases, feasibility, and usability.  </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 3px; color: #8b8e92;">Use live data to track exceptions in Receiving areas</p>
    
                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> This is a two-month project including research, design, user testing, and final hand-off. As a result, Receiving Managers are empowered to find and clear exceptions. This reduces at least 10 clicks for every manager who oversees Receiving Areas, compared to the current solution. </p>  

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> The first thing that I think went well in this project is an old cliché. Users are always ahead of competitors. Doing user research helps to find new opportunities. In this project, our design request was only to track exceptions. But when we talk to managers, we found a huge pain point: Managers need a way to a clear exceptions. This finding guides us to design our solution. When we demo our solutions to leadership and end-users, it becomes an exciting epic feature they looked forward to. </p> 

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> The second thing that worked out is to design a responsive web page. While managers spend the majority of their time in offices, they also couch the associates carrying TC 70s. Design a data table in a small android device and a large desktop was hard. There are two main design considerations: 1. Make sure the tap areas are above 48px. Managers in Distribution Centers usually have "huge fingers" problems. It was hard for them to tab on buttons that request small and precise touch. Increasing the tab areas helps to prevent this problem. 2. Make sure the content in mobile is easily digestible.  Mobile doesn't have real estate like the desktop to support a huge chunk of data in one screen. Thus we customized the data table, redesigned the search pattern, and added a middle page in the mobile version. These solutions help to keep the priority of main info and avoid long scrolls.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> This project is a great memory for me. As one of my very first launched project, I turned my prior knowledge into practice and influenced our team. I remembered  how surprised my PM was the first time I want to do a user review session. But after the first fruitful user review session, it became one of the routines for us.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 3px; color: #8b8e92;margin-top: 72px;">Data are reflections of reality</p>
    


                     <p style="margin-top: 0"> I have high expectations for data. And for a while, I thought data is the king. If we present data to users, then we are going to win. But after several rounds of user interviews. It strikes me about how users interpret data differently. Data are math, they are reflections of reality. Yet reality can be more complex than data. If the data fails to represent reality, users will feel disappointed. </p>   
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> In one of the design request, we get data from a platform called Yard Management System. Associates have been familiar with "Moves in Queue.", which is a requested feature. What can go wrong with data that users have relied on for years? After several rounds of visual tweaks, I presented it to the users confidently. They told me:" I think only the Active Moves in Queue makes sense to me as it told me what I can do right now." It is worth thinking if the data we present to users is at the right level. If only "Active Moves Numbers" are instructive, we shouldn't highlight "Total Moves Number".</p>  

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> Another learning is that users will always seek out ways to validate. Is it correct? Is the number consistent with other platforms? Are these live data or data 5mins ago? Why there are discrepancies? These questions generate moments when users choose sides. They may never use our platforms again or we can win them from other competitors.</p>

                 <p style="margin-top: 3px; color: #8b8e92;margin-top: 72px;">Design for responsiveness. </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0">In the Distribution Centers, associates and managers are always on the move. Associates have a hard case enterprise mobile phone called TC70s. Managers have TC70s, tablets, and desktop. To catch all the touchpoints, our designs have to be responsive to ensure the best experience.</p>   
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> I designed a dashboard view with several cards. I spread out information on the screen but the hierarchy is still clear. Managers can catch what is important with a glance. But when I adapt it to mobile, the cards don't work well. Users focus on what is available to them and the first card takes all the spaces.</p>  

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> I redesigned the mobile version to highlight what is most important. Secondary information is hidden behind a chevron so that users can decide when to look into which. In this way, we shortened the length of the screen and make it more efficient for users to pick what to view next. </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 3px; color: #8b8e92;margin-top: 72px;">Color Selection in Data Vis</p>
                     <p style="margin-top: 0">Red stands for errors, Yellow stands for warnings, green means everything went well. This is almost common sense for designers. But in a dashboard when we use this strategy in different cards, the product can be very color busy. I work with another designer for the same product, but not the same project. It is interesting when we share our design. He has his errors on his data card, and I have mine. He has his red color alert in the chart, and so do I. After several months, we discovered that redness is scattered in several places. We turn our users into firemen who need to put off fires on our platforms. As we iterate and test, we begin brainstorming and working together to solve this problem. We started to use grey color more often than red and use the brand color to highlight. It feels more neutral and friendly to our users. Also, we are discussing a global notification strategy to show alerts.</p>   
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> When picking the color palette, besides considering usability, branding is another key factor. There was a case where I need to pick 7 colors to stands for 7 areas in the distribution center yard.</p>  

                    <p style="margin-top: 0"> Software online like focuses on perceptual distance, contrast, and hue. But the color we picked may not work well with our brand. Walmart does have its own color palette for data visualization. And there are about 300 colors in it. from it but failed when I saw the result. The perceptual distance is low despite the contrast is high. </p> 

                     <p style="margin-top: 0"> After some struggles and talking to several other teams, I come up with a new strategy to solve this conflict between branding and usability. I used to pick a color palette. I avoided the red color because it will stand out as an error rather than a category. I dragged the perceptual distance and contrast it to the highest. I selected a hue range as wide as possible. I then get a color palette that meets the usability standard.</p> 
                      
                      <p style="margin-top: 0"> Then I mapped these colors back to our approved color palette. We picked the ones that are most similar. I and my manager mapped these colors separately and compare them together. This leads to our final color palette.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0"> In this project, I designed a categorical vis to show a type of workload data for shipping areas. One of the interesting design challenges is how to select colors. As all the Distribution Centers are different, I need to map out them to avoid color conflicts. Although the Walmart Living Design system doesn't have a guide for such vis, it provides a color pallet with 300+ approved colors. It seems hard to select 10 colors from it to show different categories clearly. </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0">I tackled this by a two-step approach: 1. Use Colorgorical.com to generate a reference pallet with 3 Walmart colors. I chose the highest perceptual distance, medium lightness, and the right color hue. This allows the vis to be clear, match the Pulse pallet lightness, and avoid alert colors. It also prevents us from randomly selecting within the 300+ colors.  2. Map the colors to Living Design System. This step helps us to maintains consistent visual language. </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0"> This is a great experience for me to find solutions to design with limits. While in school, we were taught to select colors merely based on perceptual distance; In this industry project, I need to make sure the design style is consistent with Walmart Brand. </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0"> In this project, I was redesigning Pulse tablet views. Before, Pulse was mainly designed for desktop (above 1024px) and mobile devices (360px). But in 2019, the business team decided to buy tablets for managers, which makes the view from 360px to 1024px a priority.  </p>   
                        <p style="margin-top: 0"> Here are two learnings from this process: 1. Tablets‘ information density is in the middle of desktop and mobile, with enough real estate to show enough info. But it is also crucial to keep information in a clean hierarchy in the tablets. I redesigned the placement of the dashboard to make sure users can grasp the key data at first glance. 2. Here is one possible pitfall when deciding tablet sizes. Some tablets can adjust resolutions in Settings, thus the size of a browser can be a scaled artboard size. When I found this problem, I collaborated with the dev team to verify the artboard size. To our surprise, while the spec told us the resolution is 800px * 1280px, the actual artboard is 602px * 936px. This makes the tablet we designed to fall into the category of small handheld device.  </p>
                        <p> The outcome of this project helps to finalize the missing viewports of the responsive web. The designs are launched to 10+ pilot DCs in Walmart.</p>

                       <p style="margin-top: 0"> Involved in a 2-year-old project , I gradually understand that: it is not easy to design a product. I learned a lot from my team how to do user research, how to do hand-off document, and how to argue for a feature. Handoff is never the end of design. It is always the beginning of the next better version. </p>
