        We aim to improve the user experience in this process by allowing users to better control their decisions ahead of time rather than making a random lucky one at their destination.<br><br>
        
        Through our brainstorming and pilot research, we discovered that drivers are lack of detailed parking spots information to help them know and compare the parking alternatives. Informations like detailed parking fee, operation time, remaining available spots relies on the drivers to discover until they arrive at the parking lot.

				<div class="col col-lg-8 pjcont1"><span class="pjpagesub">Semi-structured Interviews</span><br><br>I conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with drivers to collect qualitative feedback from users to dig deep into their behaviors. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7jrWc_NeCKQLZjyp-9dV_ZB79qUpKnP2FMpJqzgXJc/edit?usp=sharing" class="alink">  View Orginial Interview Script and Data</a> <br><br>
        Questions we asked include 
          <ul>
            <li>When do you need to find or search parking spots?  </li>
            <li>How do you determine where to park?  </li>
            <li>What difficulties do you have in finding the parking spots?  </li>
            <li>What app do you use to park? </li>
          </ul>
        <br>
        What is discovered is that <ul>
          <li> Drivers are in need of parking spots informations like entrance guidance, parking capacity, distance to destination, the receipt place and parking price for better parking lot alternatives;</li>
          <li> Drivers won’t search for parking lots if they know there will be a large amount of parking spot around their destination like the supermarkets or malls.</li>
          <li> Drivers tend to search for park when they are not familiar with the destination or aware of the shortage. we discovered that users are in need of parking lot information if they are unfamiliar with their destination or if they are aware there are shortage of parking place, like on a road trip or participate a game event. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        A follow-up questions was released, 7 participants respond to the short survey and prioritize the top three important factors of parking spots.

 <!--        Discovery 1: User search for park only when they are not familiar with the destination or aware of the shortage. we discovered that users are in need of parking lot information if they are unfamiliar with their destination or if they are aware there are shortage of parking place, like on a road trip or participate a game event. Users won’t search for parking lots if they know there will be a large amount of parking spot around their destination like the supermarkets or malls. And they prefer Street Parking due to relative short distance to parking destination and cheap price. Parking lot are used only when they need to park longer or cannot find a street parking. <br><br>

        Discovery 2: Competitor apps include Parkmobile, Sporthero, and Google Maps. All the participants uses Google Maps for navigation, and then search parking in that area; two of the participants has used Parkmobile and one has used Spothero before. <br><br>

        Discovery 3: When users are unfamiliar with the destination or there are limited time, they will plan ahead of time and search for a parking lot before they arrive.But most of time, users will continue drive and pay attention to surroundings to look for parking place after they arrived at the destination. <br><br>

       Discovery 4: Parking Information needed mentioned by the users include entrance guidance, parking capacity, distance to destination, the receipt place and price.<br><br>
